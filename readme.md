# Clustering 

This is a python program to solve the task of clustering. That is, agrouping datapoints following certain constrains.

I used pandas for data processing and scklearn for the classifiers. I wrote 3 implementations of preprocessing algorithms for this task.

The results are best seen with plots in the plots folder.
